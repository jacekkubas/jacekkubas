# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a frontend developer. Using a modern tech stack of **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Three.js**, I've crafted a site that prioritizes speed, interactivity, and visual appeal. Three.js adds a dynamic, 3D elements to the site bringing my portfolio to life.

Explore the codebase to see how I've integrated these technologies to create a performant, modular, and visually engaging frontend experience.
